AI-powered Website Builder: Empowering non-coders to effortlessly create stunning websites using GPT 3.5 AI and NodeJS with Express.

This repository contains an AI-powered website builder application that aims to empower non-coders to effortlessly create stunning websites. The project utilizes the Ada text model and follows a specific flow to generate website ideas and options based on user prompts.

## Flow

1. **index.html**: The landing page of the application consists of a single input field. Users can enter their website prompt, which serves as the main input for the AI model.
2. **options.html**: After submitting the prompt, users are redirected to the options page. This page features a multi-step form where users can customize various aspects of their website, such as signature style, color scheme, tags, and more.
3. **response.html**: Once users have completed the options form, the AI model generates ideas and options for the website based on the provided prompt and customization choices. This information is displayed on the response page, allowing users to explore the generated content.

## Design Process

The design process of this project was thoughtful and aimed at creating a user-friendly experience for non-coders. The flow of the application was carefully crafted to ensure a seamless journey from prompt entry to website generation. By using a multi-step form on the options page, users can customize their website according to their preferences and requirements.
